# lucyrobillard.xyz HTML Generator

This is a Rust program that takes XML (from [here](https://github.com/larobitrumpet/lucyrobillard-xml)) and generates the HTML for my website, [lucyrobillard.xyz](https://lucyrobillard.xyz), which can be found [here](https://github.com/larobitrumpet/html).

## Usage

The program accepts either one or two file names via the command line. The first file is the xml to generate from. If only one file is specified, the generated HTML is printed to standard output. If two files are specified, the second file is the output file where the generated HTML is written.
